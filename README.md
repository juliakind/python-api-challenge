#WeatherPy Observable Trends:


Scatter Plots shows that people in the Northern Hemisphere settled much closer to the Pole then in Southern Hemisphere 
There is a direct correlation between Latitude and Maximum Temperature in a city, although the Scatter plot also shows the season and temperature correlation (because of the warm season in the Southern Hemisphere, the plot shows that Maximum temperatures in cities between -20 and -40 Meridians are greater than in cities located closer to Equator)
There are no observable trends between Latitude and Humidity, therefore Humidity is most likely determined by other factor or complex of factors 
There are are no apparent correlations between Latitude and Wind Speed, as well as Latitude and Cloudiness. I believe we could extrapolate relationship between Latitude and annual climate trends and averages, but during this analysis we used current weather.
